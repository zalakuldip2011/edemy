### Step 3: Publish Course

### Supported URL Formats:
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID
https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID
```

### Best Practices:
1. **Upload Quality**: Use 1080p or higher resolution
2. **Privacy Settings**: 
   - Public: Anyone can find your video
   - Unlisted: Only people with the link can watch (recommended for courses)
   - Private: Not suitable for courses
3. **Video Length**: Keep lectures focused (5-20 minutes ideal)
4. **Thumbnails**: YouTube auto-generates thumbnails for student preview

## Publishing Options

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with Planning**: Complete Step 1 thoroughly before creating content
2. **Organize Content**: Break complex topics into smaller, digestible lectures
3. **Use YouTube**: Avoid expensive video hosting - YouTube is free and reliable
4. **Write Clear Descriptions**: Help students understand what they'll learn
5. **Set Appropriate Level**: Accurately reflect the difficulty level
6. **Test Your Videos**: Watch your YouTube videos in the preview before publishing
7. **Complete All Fields**: Fill in all required information in Step 3 before publishing

## Common Issues

### "Cannot publish course" Error
**Cause**: Missing required fields  
**Solution**: Ensure all fields marked with * are filled in Step 3

### YouTube URL Not Working
**Cause**: Invalid URL format  
**Solution**: Copy URL directly from YouTube video page

### No Preview Showing
**Cause**: Video is private or URL is incorrect  
**Solution**: Set video to Public or Unlisted, verify URL
